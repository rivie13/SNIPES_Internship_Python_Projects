# SNIPES_Internship_Python_Projects
3 small programs inside one repository for easy access.

All API keys, Organization ID's, serial numbers and other sensitive information has been replaced with stars (***)
You will need to manually go through to each variableData.py file (there are 3 one for each program) and you will need to update the API key and the orgID with your respective meraki API key and organization ID

Any files that come included with the program like a csv/excel sheet will be emptied of data for security purposes. You will need to create new spreadsheets, a new csv file, and make sure that the organization of the csv file stays the same with your new data so that the program will continue to work.

### MAKE SURE TO UPDATE ALL API KEY VARIABLES, ORGID VARIABLES, AND CSV FILE PATH IN VARIABLE DATA FILE
### MAKE SURE TO GO THROUGH ALL TEST FILES AND UPDATE THE TEST STORE SERIAL NUMBER TO AN ACTUAL MX DEVICE SERIAL NUMBER FOR A MERAKI NETWORK. PREFERABLY IT WOULD BE ANOTHER TEST STORE.....
